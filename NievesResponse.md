Nieves Response 

Question: Nieves et a. use the random forest machine learning method to predict what value globally?  Describe in detail how random forest works.  What is a dasymmetric population allocation? Which geospatial covariates proved to be the most important when predicting global values of where humans reside?

Nieves uses the random forest machine learning method to examine the relationship between population densities and candidate correlates and drivers to see which is the most important predictors of population density. 

The random forest method is a non-paramedic, nonlinear statistic method that lies under ensemble methods. This means that it combines individual decision trees (weak learners) to produce a strong learner. Doing so, it has increased generalizability, improved performance on large and small datasets, and a more effective ability to model difficult learning tasks. It is also more robust and needs less specific parameters than other methods. The way random forest methods work is that they first generate a certain number of unpruned decision trees using a method called 'bagging.' These trees are then grown with a random selection of variable to split data upon the best predictors. The one third of the bagged data that the tree was not grown upon, called the 'out-of-bag,' is used to estimate the error of the tree by applying the actual tree to the out-of-bag data. 

A dasymetric population allocation uses additional information and variables such as land cover to more accurately distribute and represent population and population density. 

The results showed that correlates pertaining to urban areas and topographical features were the most important predictors of population density at all scales of analysis. They were also the only categories that were consistently more important than other categories at all scales.
