## High resolution global gridded data for use in population studies 

#Reading Response 2/10 

Perspective Question: In the Lloyd et al. article, the authors introduce a method that uses a number of different openly available geospatial datasets in order to produce high resolution, global gridded descriptions of human populations. Describe the geospatial datasets the authors are using in their methodology. How is their method an improvement when compared to a conventional census? Are you able to describe how the authors use a number of different geospatial layers with their data science method in order to produce a high resolution, global gridded description of human population?

The new method introduced by the authors uses the GIS or the Geographic Information System to process raster topography data with vector country boundary data. 
They incorporate different layers of geospatial datasets such as settlement locations, settlement extents, land cover, roads, building maps, health facility locations, satellite nightlights, vegetation, topography, and refugee camps to produce a more accurate representation. 
They use 30 arc seconds and a 100m x 100m grid cells
