## Acquiring, Modifying and Describing the Data

The image below is a histogram that represents the population counts of each 2nd administrative subdivisions of Serbia.

The image below is a line plot that represents the population density for each 2nd administrative subdivisions of Serbia.

The image below is a combined plot that shows both the histogram of the population of the 2nd administrative subdivisions of Serbia and the line plot of the population density of the 2nd administrative subdivisions of Serbia.

The image below is similar to the image above, but instead of using a histogram of the population, it uses a histogram that shows the counts of the night time lights for each 2nd administrative subdivisions of Serbia and combines it with the density line plot.

The image below is a linear model that shows the relationship between two sets of variables. For this model, I looked at the regression model using dst190 (urban areas) and dst200 (bare areas) as the independent variables (predictors) and the population of Serbia in 2019 as the dependent variable (response).

The image below is similar to the one above, but it uses different variables for its dependent variables. It uses the water data and dst011 (herbacious cover) as the independent variables (predictors) and the population of Serbia in 2019 as the dependent variable (response).
