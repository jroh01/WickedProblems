Question 1: In the readings for Tuesday and today (Stevens et al.) the authors use a technique to produce a high resolution description of the distribution of human populations across the globe. What is the name of the technique and describe in general and basic terms how it works?

The new technique that the authors use to produce a high resolution description of the distribution of human populations across the globe is called random forest technique. It uses geospatial data that represent the modeled dasymetric weights to generate a gridded prediction of population density at about 100m spatial resolution. This is then used as the weighting surface to perform dasymetric redistribution of the census counts at a country level. 

Question 2: The random forest mehod used by the authors is a machine learning algorithm (ensemble method). In general terms, what is a machine learning algorithm? Within the context of this study what distinguishes a data science, machine learning method (such as random forest) from previous classical statistical approaches to describing and analyzing phenomenon and events? 

Question 3: In the reading the authors use a number of geospatial covariates as predictors in their machine learning mehtod. What were these geospatial covariates and approximately how big of a data set did they represent (in general terms)? What is the significance of big data in the estimation of machine learning methods for inferring the correlates and drivers of human population distributions?

In the reading, the authors use land cover data, digital elevation data and its derived slope estimates, estimates of net primary productivity, observed lights at night, climatic spatial variation data, road and waterway data, settlement/populated place locations, protected area delineations, and various facility locations. 

Question 4: The authors' results present a remarkable improvement over previous geospatial descriptions at very high resolution, of the distribution of the human population. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the significance of having a highly accurate description of where each person is located across planet earth? 

Question 5: Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the relevance to your area of investigation in having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located across planet earth?
