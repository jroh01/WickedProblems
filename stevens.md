Question 1: In the readings for Tuesday and today (Stevens et al.) the authors use a technique to produce a high resolution description of the distribution of human populations across the globe. What is the name of the technique and describe in general and basic terms how it works?

The new technique that the authors use to produce a high resolution description of the distribution of human populations across the globe is called the random forest technique. It uses geospatial data that represent the modeled dasymetric weights to generate a gridded prediction of population density at about 100m spatial resolution. This is then used as the weighting surface to perform dasymetric redistribution of the census counts at a country level. 

Question 2: The random forest mehod used by the authors is a machine learning algorithm (ensemble method). In general terms, what is a machine learning algorithm? Within the context of this study what distinguishes a data science, machine learning method (such as random forest) from previous classical statistical approaches to describing and analyzing phenomenon and events? 

Machine learning algorithm is a sub field of AI that uses already programmed algorithms to analyze input data to predict output values. The reason why it is called "machine-learning" is because over time and with new input data, the machine actually learns and optimizes its performance to improve its delivery. This machine learning method is better than the previous classical statistical approaches because of its increased accuracy. Because machine learning algorithms rely on itself instead of people's programming, it reduces error and improves accuracy. Also, machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest has the advantage of having fewer tuning parameters. 

Question 3: In the reading the authors use a number of geospatial covariates as predictors in their machine learning mehtod. What were these geospatial covariates and approximately how big of a data set did they represent (in general terms)? What is the significance of big data in the estimation of machine learning methods for inferring the correlates and drivers of human population distributions?

In the reading, the authors use land cover data, digital elevation data and its derived slope estimates, estimates of net primary productivity, observed lights at night, climatic spatial variation data, road and waterway data, settlement/populated place locations, protected area delineations, and various facility locations data as predictors in their machine learning method. These represented the whole country studied. Big data is important in the estimation of machine learning methods for human population distributions because with it everything in the country that is "human" can be shown and analyzed. Also, big data can further improve the accuracy of the machine learning algorithm with increased amounts of input data.  

Question 4: The authors' results present a remarkable improvement over previous geospatial descriptions at very high resolution, of the distribution of the human population. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the significance of having a highly accurate description of where each person is located across planet earth? 

It is extremely important to have a highly accurate description of where each person is located across planet earth because it not only helps with the representation of population growth but it also helps with the allocation of resources. There have been many cases in the past where the needed resources were inefficiently allocated to the wrong places, hindering the aid of those who needed it during outbreaks, natural disasters, etc. However, with a highly accurate description of where each person is located across the world, this allocation process can be executed efficiently. 

Question 5: Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the relevance to your area of investigation in having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located across planet earth? 

Although Serbia may seem like a stable country, it has been economically unstable since 2008. Although it is slowly getting better, Serbia has reached out to foreign sources for help and aid. Having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located in Serbia can help policy makers to allocate resources and come up with economic growth plans in order to help stabilize Serbia's economy.
